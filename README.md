# Lab: Authentication & Production Server
## Features 
- Django
  - Add JWT Authentication to your API.
    - Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.
  - Keep any pre-existing authentication so DRF Browsable API still usable.
    - Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.
- Docker
  - Create a boilerplate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml so you don’t need to start from scratch each time.
    - E.g. as a VS Code snippet, or a gist.
  - Switch to using Gunicorn instead of Django’s built in development server.
    - mind the number of workers to avoid sluggishness
